<h1> Basic Facts </h1>
<p> The blue-eyed lemur is considered critically endangered. They were even added to the top 25 most endangered primates list. 
They are so rare that only 5 breed-able blue-eyed lemurs live in North America. The blue-eyed lemurs are beautiful and the males are completely
black where the females are a shade of brown. These animals eat fruit, leaves and flowers, though that is not completely known since the specific
blue-eyed lemurs have actually not been studien in the wild. The female lemurs may only give birth to one or two lemurs at a time which is another
reason the population of blue-eyed lemurs is decreasing so drastically. These animals are very small and live around 25 years when
in captivity. It is still unknown how long these animals live in the wild. These animals desperately need our help in order to not
become extinct.</p>

<h1> Conservation </h1>
<p> Many things are being done to try and save this animal. Four females were even brought to the United States in
order to make sure they were breed and produce as many blue-eyed lemurs as possible. These animals are hunted a lot
and the area they live have wild fires often. All these factors show that many things still need to be done 
to save these animals.</p>
