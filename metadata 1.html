<!--I am writing about why I love to travel and my past experiences-->
<p>Their are many places that I dream of visiting and have visited so far.
I have traveled to places like Italy and Ireland and this summer
will be traveling to Spain. I absolutely loved these trips and created
so many memories that I will never forget.</p>


<p> As amazing as those trips were I dream os traveling more. Places at the 
top of my list include Brazil, Egypt, South Africa,Australia, Germany and the
Netherlands. I want to visit these places because they have many 
beautiful things I want to see. In Egypt I want to see the Great Pyramids 
and in Australia I want to see the Great Barrier Reef. </p>

<p> Visiting these places and many others are once in a lifetime experiences.
I hope that one day I visit these places because traveling opens
my eyes to how other people live and get te truly see the history
many of these places hold. </p>
